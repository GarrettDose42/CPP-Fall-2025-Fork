# CSC 116 - Introduction to C++ - Fall 2024

Students successfully completing CSC 116 will achieve the following learning outcomes:

- Design and implement programs observing modern C++ best practices (this offering will use the 2020 C++ Standard)
- Apply C++ standard collections, such as Strings, Vectors, Lists, Sets and Maps, to programming tasks.
- Choose practical algorithms and data structures based on the constraints of a programming task.
- Evaluate C++ expressions and types.
- Use exception semantics instead of implicit preconditions to develop more robust code.
- Analyze the run-time behavior of C++ programs, including programs whose control flow is affected by exception handling.
- Apply functional programming techniques (such as anonymous functions) to modularize code.
- Implement abstract data types (such as general-purpose collections, or application-specific interfaces) using classes and object oriented programming.
- Apply access control mechanisms to produce effectively encapsulated objects.
- Implement dynamic data structures such as lists or trees
- Produce abstracted and modular code using templates and generic programming.
- Understand and distinguish between the concepts of overloading and overriding functions.
- Implement, test, and debug recursive functions and procedures.

### Textbook

There are no required textbooks for this course, but the optional book below might be helpful if you require extra learning resources beyond those provided by the course.


> C++ Primer (5th Edition) by Lippman, Lajoie and Moo <br>
> ISBN-10: 0321714113 <br>
> ISBN-13: 978-0321714114

### Assignments

This course includes 5 equally weighted programming assignments. Students are expected to complete all assignments. The best 3 of out 5 assignments will comprise 20% of the course grade.

### Grading

To receive a passing grade in the course, the final percentage, according to the computation described below, must be 50% or higher, and the student must obtain more than 50% in the final exam.

The final percentage grade for the course will be computed as follows

Programming Assignments	20%<br>
Lab Exercises	20%<br>
Final Exam	60%<br>
